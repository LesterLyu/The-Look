# THE LOOK / TEAM 14

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, November 30, 2017
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

We completed all D3 tasks in a prioritized way. In the process, we also met a lot of problems and mde some mistakes which we should learn from. 

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1. The coding sessions turned out to be a successful decision as group members are more productive when coding together, and the communication is easier. During these coding sessions, we managed to fix a lot of bugs and finished implementing lots of functionalities in an efficient manner. For example, the navigation bug on the front-end is fixed, and we began to switch from hard coding our front-end to integrate with the back-end. These coding sessions are also fun and casual which makes the coding process more enjoyable for everyone in the team. As a result, each group member made significant contribution to the product. During these coding sessions, we can also help each other out while debugging a problem, which saves time and allows us to get more work done. 

2. If a member encountered a functionality problem (i.e. some functionality that cannot be implemented), they should first communicate with the team to decide on any alternative ways to solve it. Since we need to complete the final product on a deadline, it is not possible that we could implement every features for our product as we had planned. This decision allowed us to decide on the important features that we want to demo and give up some features so that we can complete our product by the deadline. For example, we had originally planned to use machine learning to tag, and categorize clothes from the internet. However, in order to implement this, we need to first find at least 1000 pictures and 8000 tags to train it, which is very time consuming and impossible as we only had 3 weeks before our final demo. Hence, we decided to give up machine learning and use only a subset of images to convey our idea for the demo. 

3. We started working on this iteration very early (soon after the CSC301 midterm), even before the D3 handout was released because we would like to implement as much features as possible for our final product. Hence, this allows us to have lots of time to plan out and prioritize our tasks. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1. We decided to use direct messaging (i.e. group member A to group member B) to communicate in addition to group chat about the product in the hopes that with direct messaging, we can get a response faster than with a group chat. We made this decision since we noticed from our previous iteration, there are not a lot of communication using the WeChat GroupChat. However, it turns out that this is not a great decision because this method does not provide a lot of transparency. Often times other group members does not have any knowledge about the decisions made during direct messaging. 

2. We decided to make the coding sessions optional since we understand that everyone has a different schedule and it was difficult to find a common time for all group members. For these coding sessions, we set a time range and each group member can drop in whenever they have time. However, this did not turn out as well as we hoped because some group members only have time to code for 1 hour while others will stay for the entire 5 hours. This created an inbalance in the division of work, since those who stayed for the entire 5 hour is contributing more than those who stayed for 1 hour. 

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

1. Daily Brief: Every group member is required to check-in in the group chat, give an overall summary of the status of the tasks they are currently working on. The scrum manager can then adjust the tasks assigned to make sure no one is left behind and that we can finish eveything by the deadline. 

2. Before coding, talk with the product manager / scrum manager to double check that you know what you should implement and how you are going to implement it. 

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
   
   * A fully working navigation system for the UI
   * Buttons in UI are now clickable and functional
   * Integrating front-end & back-end for storing and analyzing user profile
   * Basic authentication system (login/signup)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
   
   * Finish implementing algorithm to suggest styles according to user's profile. It turns out that this was a difficult task to implement, and since we had give up on machine learning, the algorithm that we currently have does not recommend styles as accurately as we had hoped. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Communication is the key

* We should continue to hold coding sessions

* We need to finalize the features and user workflow we plan to demo
