#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

A men style advisor app that can learn user's preferred style during the course of usage and recommend related fashion style products accordingly.

We know a big portion of men tend not to spend energy and time in shopping mall and fashion magazines, our app aims to significantly shorten the time of searching for their prefered style.

This app interprets images that user chose which fit their circumstace or preference to study and interact with user in a way such that user only need to do the minimum amount of work. For user, it is easy as Tony Stark takes off his Ironman suit.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

- Men, on young age group(less than 30), who tend not to spend energy or time on their appearance but still want to have a good look.
- Users would choose our product because it saves users time significantly by eliminating the processes of looking through style books, or going to the store to shop for clothes.
- Our product allow users to discover the current fashion trends or some styles that is right for their body type/personality/activity. They couldn't discover, or were unlikely to discover these before since our target users are people who do not like to spend much time searching for clothes or who have little fashion sense. 

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Because The Look is the one-pack solution.

To choose the right cloth will need right height, right body shape, right age group, right skin color...too many "right"s. There are tons of consultant material out there, fashion magazines, bolgs that teach you how to pick good cloth, salesman who put praise on every cloth you tried on...but all of them lacks two things: personalization and efficiency. Those are exactly what we are providing.

The Look studies user's information, from the registered information to the records of reviewing and purchasing. All the "right" will be considered as soon as user enters the app to help user find the cloth that fits him. The Look also finds all related but more fashionable styles that user prefers to help user locate the clothes he likes.

Users would choose our product because it saves users time significantly by eliminating the processes of looking through style books, or going to the store to shop for clothes. We all know that men hate that.

Furthermore, our product allow users to discover the current fashion trends or try some styles that is right for their body type/personality/activity. They couldn't discover, or were unlikely to discover these before since our target users are people who do not like to spend much time searching for clothes or who have little fashion sense. Besides, people tend to traped into certain fixed style, while our product encourages users to make change.
