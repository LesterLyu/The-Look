#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

A men style advisor app that learns user's preferred style and recommend related style product.

We know a big portion of men tend not to spend energy and time in shopping mall and fashion magazines, our app aims to significantly shorten the time of searching for their prefered style.

This app interprets images that user chose which fit their circumstace or preference to study and interact with user in a way such that user only need to do the minimum amount of work. For user, it is easy as Tony Stark takes off his Ironman suit.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Because The Look is the one-pack solution.

To choose the right cloth will need right height, right body shape, right age group, right skin color...too many "right"s. There are tons of consultant material out there, fashion magazines, bolgs that teach you how to pick good cloth, salesman who put praise on every cloth you tried on...but all of them lacks two things: personalization and efficiency. Those are exactly what we are providing.

The Look studies user's information, all the "right" will be considered as soon as user enters the app to help user find the cloth that fits him.

The Look also finds all related styles that user prefers to help user locate the clothes he likes.
