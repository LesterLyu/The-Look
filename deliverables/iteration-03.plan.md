# THE LOOK / TEAM 14

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Monday, November 27, 2017
 * End date: Thursday, Novermber 31, 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

###### Change 1: Introduced Group Coding Sessions & Code Review Sessions
One of the biggest challenges that we faced when completing Deliverable 2 was the lack of communication when we were developing our application. For Delierable 2, we decided to assign tasks to each member and write code independently. The reason behind that decision is that it was reading week and we were hoping that working independently gives each group memeber the flexibility to manage their time, so that we can be more productive and save time for arranging meetings and traveling to meet. However, this decision did not turn out as well as we hoped because it led to lack of communication which caused the problem of implementing 

###### Change 2: Change in Roles & Responsibilities

###### Change 3: Change in communication methods (more face-to-face meetings)


 * At most 3 items
 * Start with the most significant change
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it
 * Ideally, for each change, you will define a clear success metric (i.e. something you can measure at the end of the iteration to determine whether the change you made was successful)

 > *Note:* If you are not making any changes to your process, it means that you are happy with all of the decisions you made in the previous iterations.
 > In this case, list what you consider to be the most significant process decisions your team made. For each decision, explain why you consider it successful, and what success metric you are using (or could use) to assert that the decision is successful.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the **purpose** of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be to-do lists, task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
