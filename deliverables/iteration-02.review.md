# The Look/Team 14

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 14 Nov.
 * Where: Gerstein Library B172

## Process - Reflection

   We completed all D2 tasks in a prioritized way, which is good. In the process, we also met a lot problems and made some mistakes which we should learn from.

#### Decisions that turned out well

> Process decisions:

   1. We start to working on the video super-early due to we realize that it is the most prioritized thing in D2. Intro is the most difficult part of the entire video, different script of intro was written and compared in a super early stage, even earlier than D2 was announced, and intro was filmed and completed a week later. Our intro is funny and ideas are delivered well due to we have time to keep editing the script to get a better version. After the video is done and everyone had look it over, we are all satisfied. It is a good decision.

   2. We did a good job on synchronization, and for jobs that is beyond our reach, we decide to reach out for help. For example, on the app’s profile page, we cannot find any picture that describe body shape, so we decide to let some drawing guys to do the job(see Product Artifact #5). We did not solely waiting for them to get job done, instead we use text as placeholder to make sure our progress is not interrupted.
   
   3. We decide to let Backend guys keep working on Backend. We make such a decision due to we noticed that there are only 2 weeks for D3, and Backend, communication between backend and frontend are heavy work.By start early on backend, now we have a foundation of it by now, and it is also a good start for D3.

   3. We decide to give up on machine learning. Machine learning was fancy and powerful, we wanted to train one for the app so it can fetch, tag and categorize clothes from internet and no human intervention will be needed. But at the end of D2 we found out that the value added part of The Look is not from machine learning, but mostly from the 2 layer filter system we designed. Even it is machine learning it has to apply the same filter logic, and we have to find at least 1000 pictures and 8000 tags to train it, which is clearly impossible due to D3 only has 2 weeks. So we decide to give up on that, this is going to save us tons of time and effort in D3.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

> Process decisions:

   1. Due to it is in reading week, we decide to write code independently in order to be more flexible.  It turned out to be a bad decision. This decision lead to lack of communication and management. We ended up facing overlapping implementation of same functionality, front end logic is different than what product manager required and some pages cannot work in the app frame.

   2. Decide to use Wechat GroupChat as communication tool which caused lack of communication. During the implementation of user interface, our communication is poor. Everyone is doing their own job and rarely talk to each other. This is due to we work independently, and everyone’s working hour are different. For example, if A is implementing task 1 and he needs info from B and C, has to coordinate with E and F, B,C,E,F may not be online while A is asking them questions on WeChat Group Chat. After BCEF replied hours later, A has already gone to the wrong way. This kind of communication is slow, inefficient and ineffective, and it makes people don’t want to talk to each other much due to those drawbacks. WeChat is a good communication tool on the early stage of the project when people are talking about high-level ideas, due to you only have to drop in and participate. Now we need more face-to-face communication which can really make things clear.

   3. We decide to let backend guys to keep working on backend. This decision causes there aren’t enough human resource to work on the app at the later stage of D2 due to the front end group have to also get the video done. We have to dispatch some members of backend team to work on front end to ensure the progress.

#### Planned changes

> These two the more important than the rest due to what follows is a coding-heavy period, we need to ensure our productivity.

1. Coding session. 
 * People are more productive when coding together due to the atmosphere and communication are easier. 

2. Morning brief. 
 * It helps us make sure that no one is left behind, even if there are, scrum manager can adjust that quickly.

> Following are procedures that we designed to avoid unnecessary problems.

3. Code review session. It helps us to have a cleaner, more bug-free application.

4. Before coding, talk to product manager/ scrum manager to double check that you know what you should implement, so things like overlapping functionality implement by different member won’t happen again.

5. If a member encountered a functionality problem(e.g. some functionality cannot be implemented), talk to product manager and scrum manager first, don’t try to find an alternative way to solve it, it might impact the bigger picture. It make sure things like logic is different than what product manager request won’t happen.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

  * A displayable and clickable user interface.

  * Basic structure of Backend.

  * Design of structure and tag system.

  * (not planned) logo design.

  
  * (not planned) profile page picture drawing (see Product Artifact #5).
  
   
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * According to our plan.md, we actually completed all tasks.

## Meeting Highlights

 * Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Communication is the key.

 * Before coding, talk to product manager/ scrum manager to double check that you know what you should implement, so things like overlapping functionality implement by different member won’t happen again.

 * If a member encountered a functionality problem(e.g. some functionality cannot be implemented), talk to product manager and scrum manager first, don’t try to find an alternative way to solve it, it might impact the bigger picture. It make sure things like logic is different than what product manager request won’t happen.

 * If you encounter a bug that you can't solve, don't leave it there, talk to other people.
