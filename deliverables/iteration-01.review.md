# THE LOOK

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Tuesday October 10 11:00am - 1:00pm
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

* We Communicated and commented through the WeChat group, everyone participated and we can see the ideas discussed through WeChat history.
* We Keep a _Track Board_ to help team members to keep track of their goals and responsibilities. **TODO: WHY**
* We have face-to-face meetings every week, it is more efficient than online video meetings. **TODO: WHY**

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Online video meetings in place of face-to-face meetings. More convenient but turned out to be much less efficient than face-to-face meetings. Moreover, there were some technical problems with noise from microphones.
* Planned to have a little meeting every day, but after some discussions, we found it is unnecessary. Additional meetings will be held if we encounter important matters that we have to figure out together.
#### Planned changes

* We plan to reduce online video meetings and organize more face-to-face meetings (hold physical meetings twice per week at current stage, more meeting after coding starts)
* Add more details to the track board to keep track of additional information such as important notes or updates to the project that everyone should be aware of

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Singled out one idea for our project
* Decided on some basic features of the product 
  * Profile our users by their favor
  * Gain the information about user's favor in an interactive manner instead of filling a long form.
  * Recommend product that matches users' profile
  * User's feedback on a product will update both his/her profile and the ranking of that product

* Decided on framework/language to use for building the application
  * React Native for front end
  * MongoDB, Node.js for back end

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Gather data, and research existing APIs to use in our product
  * we wanted to implement our key features and user workflow first using fake data first before incorporating with real-world fashion brands and outfits

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Everyone in the team should come to each meeting prepared with ideas or questions about the current state of the project
* We should plan out our next goals and start assigning task to each member
