# THE LOOK

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Tuesday October 10 11:00am - 1:00pm
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

* We Communicated and commented through the WeChat group, everyone participated and we can see the ideas discussed through WeChat history. WeChat communication is super convenient since it is not necessary that everyone is online at the same time. When someone provides an idea, the others can reveiw the chat history to catch up the discussion. It is a good complement of face-to-face meeting and on-line meeting. It also makes good preparation for formal meetings.
* We Keep a _Track Board_ to help team members to keep track of their goals and responsibilities. **TODO: WHY**
* We have face-to-face meetings every week. Since the face-to-face meeting schedule is fixed on every Tuesday morning before the tutorial, every member can guarantee to participate it. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Online video meetings in place of face-to-face meetings. More convenient but turned out to be much less efficient than face-to-face meetings. It took us one hour to set up the on-line meeting and many member were late. Moreover, there were some technical problems with noise from microphones. More self-dicipline are needed in order to make sure the success of on-line meeting. 
* Planned to have a little meeting every day, but after some discussions, we found it is unnecessary. Additional meetings will be held if we encounter important matters that we have to figure out together.
#### Planned changes

* We plan to reduce online video meetings and organize more face-to-face meetings (hold physical meetings twice per week at current stage, more meeting after coding starts)
* Add more details to the track board to keep track of additional information such as important notes or updates to the project that everyone should be aware of

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Singled out one idea for our project. 
  We brought out 9 ideas at the beginning. Some of them are lack of creativity, some are not convenient to use, and some are pure CRUD. After the first plan meeting, we screen out two ideas for discussion with TA during tutorial. And after the first tutorial, we determined to build a men's style advisor app. 
  
* The goal of the product and target users
    We have make clear that the goal of our product is to help young men improve their appearance. There are a large number of young men who are fond of tasting new technology but hate wasting time shopping or not get a clue of fashion. However they also have the necessity  of showing off personality and chasing girls. They are our inborn users.
    This goal of the product and the target users had never been changed since the idea was brought out.
    
* Decision on some basic features of the product 
    The features of the product were quite arguable. We first wanted to edit many fashionable suits and then just recommended them to the users. But this needed many fashion editors and they are out of our resources. Besides, our app does not have much value if the clothes are recommened by human beings. After several rounds of discussion and under the help of TA, we finaly decided to change the app into a intellegent recommendation system. First of all, it gains minimum necessary personal information of users, like gender, age and body form instead of filling a long form through sign up. Then it can learn user's preference, for example color, during the users' reviewing and purchasing. Based on the users' basic information and preference, our app will intellegently recommmend fashionable and trendy clothes to change their style and improve their appearance. We can also add more value to the app as addition function such as comparing price for the similar style products, and providing app database interface to the clothing producers or brand owners. 
  * Gain the information about user's favor in an interactive manner instead of filling a long form
  * learn users' preference
  * Recommend product that matches users' profile
  * Comparing price for the similar style products
  * providing app database interface to the clothing producers or brand owners
  
* Decided on framework/language to use for building the application
  * React Native for front end
  * MongoDB, Node.js for back end

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Gather data, and research existing APIs to use in our product
  * we wanted to implement our key features and user workflow first using fake data first before incorporating with real-world fashion brands and outfits

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Everyone in the team should come to each meeting prepared with ideas or questions about the current state of the project
* We should plan out our next goals and start assigning task to each member
