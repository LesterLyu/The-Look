# THE LOOK

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Tuesday October 14 11:00am - 1:00pm
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
* Communicating and commenting through WeChat group, everyone is participating and we can see the ideas discuessed through chat history
* Keeping a Track Board to help team members and the team keep track of goals and responsiblities
* Face-to-face meetings every week, more efficient than online video meetings

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Online video meetings in place of face-to-face meetings. More convenient but turned out to be much less efficient than face-to-face meetings. Also there was some technical problems with noise from microphones.
* Planned to have a little meeting every day, but after some discussion we found it unnecessary. Additional meetings will be held if we encounter important matters that we have to figure out together.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
* We plan to reduce online video meetings and organize more face-to-face meetings (hold physical meetings twice per week)
* Add more details to the track board to keep track of additional information such as important notes or updates to the project that everyone should be aware of

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Finalized project idea
* Decided on the features of the product
  * [TODO]
  * [LIST SOME FEATURES OF THE PRODUCT]
  * After user's first login, he/she will be redirected to a page with 8 pictures with outfits with different styles, user need to choose his/her favourite style to provide our recommend algorithm with some basic information about the user.
* Assigned roles and responsiblities to every team member
* Decided on framework/language to use for building the application
  * React Native for front end
  * MongoDB, Node.js, Express for back end

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Gather data, and research existing APIs to use in our product
  * we wanted to implement our key features and user workflow first using fake data first before incorporating with real-world fashion brands and outfits

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Everyone in the team should come to each meeting prepared with contribute their ideas or questions about the current state of the project
* We should plan out our next goals and start assigning task to each member
